 -The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
 -It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s

 -The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate
  how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.

 -OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standard in 1984.
